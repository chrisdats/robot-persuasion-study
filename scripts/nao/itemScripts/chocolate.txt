Here we have a decadent bar <point return> <look participant> of chocolate made in Belgium, with the flavor of <point lift> almond, sea salt, <point return>and dark chocolate.

<look participant> Dark chocolate <point head> is definitely my favorite kind of chocolate! <point return>

This bar is 55 percent coco content which <point lift> is very high, <point return> meaning it is a relatively high quality bar.
 
Additionally, it is organic. Unlike other chocolates that are farmed with underpaid laborers with <pointandlook item> outdated methods, this is certified <look participant><point return> by Switzerland as For Life.

This means that the coca beans were cultivated in a socially responsible and sustainable manner, with care given to the coca bean farmers and their families. So it helps protects the environment and <point item> it helps draw out <point return> all the taste from the coca beans.

The almonds are a delicious touch, <look participant> <point participant> and if you like the combination <point return> of salt and chocolate, like a chocolate covered pretzel or m and ms in trail mix, you will love this flavor.
Crunchy almonds and sea salt crystals make a tantilizing combination which brings out the complexity of the chocolate. It very smooth and buttery, but not too sweet.

It is a great gift <look participant> so you can give it to your mother because its delicious.

But with a love <point item> poem inside, these bars <point return> are also great to share with a special someone.

You can <point lift> also chop it <point return> up into pieces and share with friends.
