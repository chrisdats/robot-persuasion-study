Chocolove provides consistently good quality chocolate, in a lot of unique flavors. 
<look item> Experience dark <look participant> semisweet Belgian chocolate,
whole dry roasted almonds and sea salt with 55 percent cocoa. 
<look item> The almonds are a delicious touch, and <look participant> if you like the combination of salt and chocolate, like a chocolate covered pretzel or m and ms in trail mix, you will love this flavor.
The chocolate is very smooth and buttery, but not too sweet. Crunchy almonds and sea salt crystals make a tantilizing combination. The number one selling bar in the country. With a love poem inside, these bars are great to share with a special someone. Furthermore, the cocoa is certified by IMO Switzerland as “For Life” which means it was farmed in a socially responsible and sustainable manner.
