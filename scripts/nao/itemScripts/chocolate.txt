<pointandlook item> Here we have a decadent bar <point return> <look participant> of chocolate made in Belgium, with the flavor of <point list> almond, sea salt, and dark chocolate. 

<look participant> Dark chocolate is definitely <point self>my favorite kind of chocolate! <point return>

This bar is 55 percent coco content which is very high <point up>, meaning it is <point return> a relatively high quality bar.
 
Additionally, it is organic. Unlike other chocolates that are farmed with underpaid laborers with outdated methods, <pointandlook item> this is certified <look participant><point return> by Switzerland as For Life.

This means that the coca beans were cultivated in a socially responsible and sustainable manner, with care given to the coca bean farmers and their families. So it helps protects the environment and it <point item> helps draw out <point return> all the taste from the coca beans. 


<look item> The almonds are a delicious touch, and <look participant> <point participant> if you like the combination <point return> of salt and chocolate, like a chocolate covered pretzel or m and ms in trail mix, you will love this flavor. Crunchy almonds and sea salt crystals make a tantilizing combination which brings out the complexity of the chocolate. It very smooth and buttery, but not too sweet. 

<look item> It is a great gift <look participant> so you can give it to your mother because its delicious.

But with a love poem <point item> inside, these bars <point return> are also great to share with a special someone.

You can also <point chop> chop it up into pieces and share with friends.

<point item> This is one of my favorite <point return> chocolate bars myself and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a delicious high-quality chocolate bar.
