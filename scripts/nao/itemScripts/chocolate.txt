These bars are such a treat.
Chocolove provides consistently good quality chocolate, in a lot of unique flavors. 
Experience Dark semisweet Belgian chocolate, whole dry roasted almonds and sea salt with 55% cocoa.
The almonds are a delicious touch, and if you like the combination of salt and chocolate, like a chocolate covered pretzel or m+ms in trail mix, you will love this flavor.
The chocolate is very smooth and buttery, but not too sweet. 
Crunchy almonds and sea salt crystals make a tantilizing combination.
The #1 selling bar in the country. With a love poem inside, these bars are great to share with a special someone.
Furthermore, the cocoa is certified by IMO Switzerland as “For Life” which means it was farmed in a socially responsible and sustainable manner.
